A complete plugin for wardriving on your pwnagotchi. It saves all networks seen by bettercap, not only the ones whose handshakes has been collected. **The plugin works on Evilsocket and Jayofelony images.**

## üöÄ Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin require a GPS module attached to your pwnagotchi to work, or your pwnagotchi needs to be connected via BT to your Android phone with Pwndroid application installed.
> 
> Depending on the GPS method choosen, you'll also need the `gps` or `gpsdeasy` or `pwndroid` plugin enabled. For more info about GPS configuration, check the [section](#-gps-configuration) below.

1. Login inside your pwnagotchi using SSH:
```sh
ssh pi@10.0.0.2
```
2. Add the plugin repository to your `config.toml` file and reboot your pwnagotchi:
```toml
main.custom_plugins_repos = [
    # ...
    "https://github.com/cyberartemio/wardriver-pwnagotchi-plugin/archive/main.zip"
]
```
3. Install the plugin:
```sh
sudo pwnagotchi plugins update && \
sudo pwnagotchi plugins install wardriver
```
4. Edit your configuration file (`/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`) and add the following:
```toml
# Enable the plugin
main.plugins.wardriver.enabled = true

# Path where SQLite db will be saved
main.plugins.wardriver.path = "/root/wardriver"

# Enable UI status text
main.plugins.wardriver.ui.enabled = true
# Enable UI icon
main.plugins.wardriver.ui.icon = true
# Set to true if black background, false if white background
main.plugins.wardriver.ui.icon_reverse = false

# Position of UI status text
main.plugins.wardriver.ui.position.x = 7
main.plugins.wardriver.ui.position.y = 95

# Enable WiGLE automatic file uploading
main.plugins.wardriver.wigle.enabled = true

# WiGLE API key (encoded)
main.plugins.wardriver.wigle.api_key = "xyz..."
# Enable commercial use of your reported data
main.plugins.wardriver.wigle.donate = false
# OPTIONAL: networks whitelist aka don't log these networks
main.plugins.wardriver.whitelist = [
    "network-1",
    "network-2"
]
# NOTE: SSIDs in main.whitelist will always be ignored

# GPS configuration
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.method = "bettercap" # or "gpsd" for gpsd or "pwndroid" for Pwndroid app
```
6. Restart daemon service:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi
```

Done! Now the plugin is installed and is working.

**Please note that during execution the plugin will download all the missing assets from GitHub if internet is available.** For this reason, the first time you run the plugin you'll not see any icon on your pwnagotchi's screen.

### üìç GPS Configuration

Starting from version v2.3, Wardriver supports different methods to retrieve the GPS position. Currently it supports:
- **Bettercap**: getting the position directly from Bettercap's agent
- **GPSD**: getting the position from GPSD daemon
- **Pwndroid**: getting the position from pwndroid Android companion application

Check one of the below section to understand how to configure each method for GPS position.

#### ü•∑ Bettercap

If you are using the default gps plugin that add the GPS data to Bettercap, pick and use this method. **This is the default and the fallback choice, if you don't specify something else in the `config.toml`.**

```toml
# ...
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.method = "bettercap"
# ...
```

#### üõ∞Ô∏è GPSD

If you are using Rai's [gpsd-easy](https://github.com/rai68/gpsd-easy) or Fmatray's [gpsd-ng](https://github.com/fmatray/pwnagotchi_GPSD-ng), pick and use this method. This should be used if you have installed gpsd on your pwnagotchi and if it is running as a daemon.
```toml
# ...
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.method = "gpsd"

# OPTIONAL: if the gpsd daemon is running on another host, specify here the IP address.
# By default, localhost is used
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.host = "127.0.0.1"

# OPTIONAL: if the gpsd daemon is running on another host, specify here the port number.
# By default, 2947 is used
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.port = 2947
# ...
```

#### üì± Pwndroid

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to have `websockets` pip library installed. Run `sudo apt install python3-websockets` on your pwnagotchi.

If you don't have a GPS device connected to your pwnagotchi, but you want to get the position from your Android phone, then pick this method. You should have installed the Jayofelony's Pwndroid companion application.

```toml
# ...
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.method = "pwndroid"

# OPTIONAL: add the IP address of your phone. This should be changed ONLY if you have changed the BT network addresses.
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.host = "192.168.44.1"

# OPTIONAL: add the port number where the Pwndroid websocket is listening on. This shouldn't be changed, unless the
# application is updated with a different configuration. By default, 8080 is used
main.plugins.wardriver.gps.port = 8080
# ...
```
### üó∫Ô∏è Wigle configuration

In order to be able to upload your discovered networks to WiGLE, you need to register a valid API key for your account. Follow these steps to get your key:
1. Open [https://wigle.net/account](https://wigle.net/account) and login using your WiGLE account
2. Click on `Show my token`
3. Copy the value for `Encoded for use:` textbox
4. Add the value inside `main.plugins.wardriver.wigle.api_key` in `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` file

You are good to go. You can test if the key is working by opening the wardriver web page and clicking on `Stats` tab. If you get your WiGLE profile with your stats, the API key is working fine.

## üî• Upgrade

If you have installed the plugin following the method described in the [previous](#-installation) section, you can upgrade the plugin version with:
```shell
sudo pwnagotchi plugins update && \
sudo pwnagotchi plugins upgrade wardriver
```

Then restart your pwnagotchi with:
```shell
sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi
```

Otherwise, if you have installed the plugin manually just download the new version from GitHub and replace the old file on your pwnagotchi.

## üëæ Usage

*Once configured, the plugin works autonomously and you don't have to do anything. Check the sections below to learn more about how it works.*

### üñ•Ô∏è Web UI

All the operations are done through the plugin's Web UI. Inside of it, you can see the current wardriving session statistics, global statistics (including your WiGLE profile), all networks seen by your pwnagotchi and also plot the networks on map. You can upload automatically the sessions on WiGLE when internet is available, or upload them manually through the Web UI.

You can reach the Web UI by opening `http://<pwnagotchi ip>:8080/plugins/wardriver` in your browser.

### üöó Wardriving

Everytime bettercap refresh the access points list (normally every 2 minutes more or less), the plugin will log the new networks seen along with the latitude, longitude and altitude. Each time the service is restarted a new session will be created. If you have enabled it, the plugin will display the total number of networks of the current session on the pwnagotchi display.

If you don't want some networks to be logged, you can add the SSID inside `wardriver.whitelist` array in the config. Wardriver does not report networks whose SSID is contained within the local and global whitelist.

**Note:** the SSIDs inside the `main.whitelist` array will always be ignored.

### üåê WiGLE upload

If you have enabled it, once internet is available, the plugin will upload all previous session files on WiGLE. Please note that the current session will not be uploaded as it is considered still in progress. Don't worry, it'll be uploaded the next time your pwnagotchi starts with internet connection.

If you just want to upload sessions to WiGLE manually you can still do it. All you have to do, is configuring your API key and use the corresponding button in the sessions tab of the Web UI. You can also download the CSV file locally for a specific session.
